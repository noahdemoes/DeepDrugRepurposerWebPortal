# Deep Drug Repurposer Web Portal

## Summary
In 2017, the international pharmaceutical industry generated over USD 934 billion in revenue and is expected to grow to over $1,170 billion in 2021. [1] Although people are willing to pay for pharmaceuticals, the cost associated with creating a new, breakthrough drugs are costly and often unsuccessful. Only 12% of drugs that are in clinical phase will be approved for market. [5] Drug development for a single drug costs USD 2.6 billion and 17 years to develop on average. [5] Development regulations drive over 10 percent of this cost, averaging USD 339.3 million dollars. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires three phases of clinical testing: determining human safety and dosing (phase 1), initial reading of efficacy and side effects (phase 2), and larger clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy in larger numbers (phase 3). [3] Bypassing any stage in this process could create cost and time savings for drug development and reduce the burden on consumers. Even more, a breakthrough in drug-receptor repurposing could bypass toxicity stages in drug trials, and save tens of millions of dollars for a single effort to treat a disease. 

Now that we have developed a model that correctly classifies potential candidate drugs fill in the current accuracy of our model, we look to accomplish two objectives. The first is to optimize our model. We will conduct hyper parameter tuning, evaluate cutoff thersholds for our binary classifier, and determine best performance metric. The second is to build a web application. We will build a user interface (UI) that customers and researchers can utilize to find potential target genes given a specific pre approved drug. This UI will be deployed as a web portal that users can access. This tool will also enable researchers to include negative samples, drug, gene combinations that they tried and did not work to increase the models efficacy.  A user will be able to enter a specific drug receptor listed in the database, and the portal will produce a possible new drug. By creating an inviting, intuitive UI researchers will be more likely to use this platform to reduce production cost and hopefully increase the number of new drug gene cures.
